Not Mobile Device Edit Friendly The app is not beginner user-friendly and there is no introduction on how to use the app when you first download and join.All major edits (e.g. deleting a channel or workspace) can only be done on a desktop. If set up can be done on a mobile device, all editing should possible on a mobile device as well, especially when there is no introduction on how to use the app. I liked the location detection and would love to see it evolve.
